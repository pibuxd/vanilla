## Adding a new package to the [repositories]("https://pibux.pl/repos")
+ it can be a binary or a source
+ have to be compressed into tar.gz
+ Makefile has to be included where `sudo make install` installs and `sudo make remove` removes a package
+ have to type dependiences in string like "firstackage second third"
+ the first time the package is thrown in, it needs a password
+ every update of package needs password entry
